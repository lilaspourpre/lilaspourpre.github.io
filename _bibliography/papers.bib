  abstract = {We present a new approach based on the Personalized Federated Learning algorithm MeritFed that can be applied to Natural Language Tasks with heterogeneous data. We evaluate it on the Low-Resource Machine Translation task, using the dataset from the Large-Scale Multilingual Machine Translation Shared Task (Small Track #2) and the subset of Sami languages from the multilingual benchmark for Finno-Ugric languages. In addition to its effectiveness, MeritFed is also highly interpretable, as it can be applied to track the impact of each language used for training. Our analysis reveals that target dataset size affects weight distribution across auxiliary languages, that unrelated languages do not interfere with the training, and auxiliary optimizer parameters have minimal impact. Our approach is easy to apply with a few lines of code, and we provide scripts for reproducing the experiments at thishttps://github.com/VityaVitalich/MeritFed}

Collected cases provide the ability to form nearly any type of graph operation. We test the collected dataset for learning taxonomy structure based on English WordNet and compare different input templates for fine-tuning LLMs. Moreover, we apply the fine-tuned models on such datasets on the downstream tasks achieving state-of-the-art results on the TexEval-2 dataset.",

We also select the most time- and memory-effective pipeline by comparing separately fine-tuned Transformer Encoder models which show state-of-the-art performance on the subtasks with Generative LLMs in few-shot and LoRA setups.

To solve the task, we leverage lexical knowledge from the pre-trained models to predict new words missing in the taxonomic resource. We propose a method that combines graph-, and text-based contextualized representations from transformer networks to predict new entries to the taxonomy. We have evaluated the method suggested for this task against text-only baselines based on BERT and fastText representations. The results demonstrate that incorporation of graph embedding is beneficial in the task of hyponym prediction using contextualized models. We hope the new challenging task will foster further research in automatic text graph construction methods.",

As oppose to the traditional task formulation (where the list of new words is provided beforehand), we provide an approach for automatic extension of a taxonomy using a large pre-trained language model. As an advantage to the existing visualisation tools of WordNet, TaxFree also integrates graphic representations of synsets from ImageNet.
